# motokolearn

Motokolearn is a Motoko package meant to facilitate on-chain training and inference of machine learning models where having a large GPU powered server farms is not a requirement. 

### Why do we care about small to mid-sized data problems not requiring a GPU?​

- Small to medium size data problems of heterogenous "tabular" data is often better solved with ensemble of boosted trees​

- From personal experience, 1) many Kaggle challenges (including those I won) are better solved with ensembles of trees. 2) Last year alone, I consulted with three medium sized startups and all projects involved data bases below 100 megabytes and none of them required the use of deep learning.

## Package installation using github

1) Install mops package manager: https://docs.mops.one/quick-start
2) Install the Motoko Base library in your project using mops:
```bash
mops add base
```
3) Install fuzz package:
```bash
mops add fuzz
```
4) Clone this repository in the base of your project:
```
cd <yourproject>
git clone https://github.com/ildefons/motokolearn.git
```

If you want to test your project locally, you can use the following commands:

```bash
# Starts the replica, running in the background
dfx start --background

# Deploys your canisters to the replica and generates your candid interface
dfx deploy
```

Once the job completes, your application will be available at `http://localhost:4943?canisterId={asset_canister_id}`.

If you have made changes to your backend canister, you can generate a new candid interface with

```bash
npm run generate
```

at any time. This is recommended before starting the frontend development server, and will be run automatically any time you run `dfx deploy`.

If you are making frontend changes, you can start a development server with

```bash
npm start
```

Which will start a server at `http://localhost:8080`, proxying API requests to the replica at port 4943.

### Note on frontend environment variables

If you are hosting frontend code somewhere without using DFX, you may need to make one of the following adjustments to ensure your project does not fetch the root key in production:

- set`DFX_NETWORK` to `ic` if you are using Webpack
- use your own preferred method to replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` in the autogenerated declarations
  - Setting `canisters -> {asset_canister_id} -> declarations -> env_override to a string` in `dfx.json` will replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` with the string in the autogenerated declarations
- Write your own `createActor` constructor
